Autism Prediction (Machine Learning Project)

This is my first Machine Learning project. For this project I will be using the ML Olympiad - Autism Prediction Challenge dataset from Kaggle You can find the dataset [here](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/autism-prediction/overview).

I have managed to achieve a public score of 0.88 on Kaggle with my submission. It has been a wonderful journey analysing this dataset and applying the various concepts of machine learning and using libraries like Sci-Kit-Learn, Pandas and NumPy.
